Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Alexander Paul M.J. Stevens, currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the Research Centre for Information Systems Engineering (LIRIS) at KU Leuven.

This website is meant to elaborate more on the interesting fields related to *responsible AI*: Explainability, Counterfactual Explanations, Robustness, and Fairness. I have touched upon these fields in my work as a Ph.D. researcher, mainly in the context of business processes. You can find out more information about my papers on these subjects on the page **papers** in the top right corner. If you have any questions or want to have interesting discussions about these topics, feel free to contact me!
