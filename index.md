Hello 👋, my name is Alexander Paul M.J. Stevens, currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the Research Centre for Information Systems Engineering (LIRIS) at KU Leuven.

This website is meant to elaborate more on the interesting fields related to <strong>responsible AI</strong>: Explainability, Counterfactual Explanations, Robustness, and Fairness. I have touched upon these fields in my work as a Ph.D. researcher, mainly in the context of business processes. You can find more information about my papers on these subjects on the page <strong>papers</strong> in the top right corner.
