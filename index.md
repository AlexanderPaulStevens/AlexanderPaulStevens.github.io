Hello, my name is Alexander Paul Stevens, Ph.D. Student at the Research Centre for Information Systems Engineering (LIRIS), KU Leuven.

This website is meant to inform interested researcher more about the interesting fields that I work in: Explainability, Robustness and Fairness, mainly in Process Outcome Prediction. In these pages (in the top right corner), you will find more information about these papers. If you have any questions, or want to have interesting discussions about these topics, feel free to contact me!
