Hello, my name is Alexander Paul Stevens, doctoral researcher (Ph.D.) at the Research Centre for Information Systems Engineering (LIRIS), KU Leuven.

On this page, you will find an overview of my accepted papers (see posts underneath). Additionally, this website is also meant to inform interested researcher more about the interesting fields that I work in: **Explainability** and **Robustness**, mainly in Process Outcome Prediction. In these pages (in the top right corner), you will find interesting books, papers, or just interesting insights about these topics. Enjoy!
