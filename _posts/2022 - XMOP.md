Predicting the outcome of various sorts of processes has seen a strong uptake in recent years
due to the advances in machine and deep learning. Although a recent shift has been made in
the field of process outcome prediction to use models from the explainable artificial intelligence
field, the evaluation still occurs mainly through predictive performance-based metrics, thus not
accounting for the explainability, actionability, and implications of the results of the models. This
paper addresses explainability through the properties interpretability and faithfulness in the field
of process outcome prediction. We introduce metrics to analyse these properties along the main
dimensions of (business) process data: the event, case, and control flow attributes. This allows
comparing inherently created explanations with post-hoc explanations techniques, for which we
benchmark seven classifiers on thirteen real-life events logs covering a range of transparent and
non-transparent machine learning and deep learning models complemented with post-hoc (modelagnostic
or model-dependent) explainability techniques. Next, this paper contributes a set of
guidelines named X-MOP which allows selecting the appropriate model by providing insight into
how the varying preprocessing, model complexity, and explainability techniques typical in process
outcome prediction influence the explainability of the model.
